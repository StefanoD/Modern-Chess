## Naming Conventions
| Chess Wiki  | Modern Chess     |
|-------------|------------------|
| pieces [^1] | figures          |
| sq          | squares          |
| noEa        | northEast        |
| noEaOne     | oneStepNorthEast |
| wPawns      | whitePawns       |
| bPawns      | blackPawns       |
| empty [^2]  | emptySquares     |

[^1]: *pieces* in correct chess terminology excludes pawns, while in Chess Programming Wiki it includes pawns. 
This misunderstanding is corrected with the more general term *figures*

[^2]: Referring to an *empty board*. The name suggests there is a board with no figures on it
which is misleading. Instead, we have a board representation where empty squares are set to 1
and non-empty squares are set to 0.
